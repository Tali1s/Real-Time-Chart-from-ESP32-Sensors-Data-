# Real-Time-Chart-from-ESP32-Sensors-Data

In this project are used two sensors: DS18B20 (Temperature) and BH1750(Lux).    
Via HTTP Library for esp32, data are shared for web through HTTP Methods (GET,POST).    
Data are stored in MySQL Database and then with JSON and HighCharts we have Real Time Chart for sensors that we used.
